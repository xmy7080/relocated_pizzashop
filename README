I am using activator UI to build and run this app.

basic logic:
there are three presaved user(admin, bob, kate), there password is (1111,2222,3333),
user admin can view all the orders taken today. while other users only can view theirs.

new users are open to create, just navigate in sign up page and put username and password in.
